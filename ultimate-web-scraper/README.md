Ultimate Web Scraper Toolkit
============================

A PHP library of tools designed to handle all of your web scraping needs under a MIT or LGPL license.  This toolkit easily makes RFC-compliant web requests that are indistinguishable from a real web browser, a web browser-like state engine for handling cookies and redirects, and a full cURL emulation layer for web hosts without the PHP cURL extension installed.  Simple HTML DOM is included to easily extract the desired content from each retrieved document.

Features
--------

* Carefully follows the IETF RFC Standards surrounding the HTTP protocol.
* Supports file transfers, SSL, and HTTP/HTTPS/CONNECT proxies.
* Easy to emulate various web browser headers.
* A web browser-like state engine that emulates redirection (e.g. 301) and automatic cookie handling for managing multiple requests.
* Extensive callback support.
* A full cURL emulation layer for drop-in use on web hosts that are missing cURL.
* Includes Simple HTML DOM to easily parse and extract the desired content from HTML.
* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.
* Designed for relatively painless integration into your project.
* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.
